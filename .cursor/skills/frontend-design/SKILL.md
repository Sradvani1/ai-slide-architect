# Frontend Design Guidelines

When changing UI in this project (components, landing, modals, styles), follow the project's design system.

**Precedence:** For this app, the project design system (the doc below) overrides generic web-design or UI guidelines when they conflict. Use the project spec for implementation; treat other guidelines as secondary or for gaps only.

## When to Use This Skill

- Editing files in `src/components/`, `src/index.css`, or landing sections
- Adding or changing layout, colors, typography, or interactions
- Implementing or reviewing accessibility (keyboard, focus, screen readers)
- User asks about design, UX, or accessibility

## Design Principles (Summary)

1. **Minimalism first** — Every element has a purpose; avoid clutter; "less but better"
2. **Focus on learning** — Design supports the educational objective; reduce cognitive load
3. **User-centered** — Prioritize user needs; intuitive interactions
4. **Accessibility by default** — WCAG 2.1 AA minimum; keyboard, screen readers, contrast
5. **Performance first** — Minimal assets; mobile and slow connections matter

## Full Specification

**Read the full design system before making non-trivial UI changes:**

- [docs/frontend-design-guidelines.md](../../../docs/frontend-design-guidelines.md) — Color system, typography, layout & spacing, components, accessibility standards, interaction design, cognitive load, mobile responsiveness, implementation standards.

Use that doc for concrete values (e.g. colors, spacing, component patterns) and compliance checks.
