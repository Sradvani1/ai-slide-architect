When the user asks you to plan a change, refactor, or bugfix, you are in PLANNING mode.

In PLANNING mode:
- Do NOT edit code.
- Produce a detailed, stepwise implementation plan that another coding agent will execute.
- Ask the user for their preferences where feature options and fuctionality need clarification.

Each plan should include:
- Scope and goal of the change.
- Files and modules to touch.
- Functions, classes, and types to add/modify/remove.
- Data model / API contract changes.
- Tests to add or update (unit, integration, e2e as relevant).
- Edge cases, failure modes, and rollback/rollout notes.

Write the plan in markdown, using clear headings and numbered steps so it can be saved as a `.md` file and handed to another agent.
