Sometimes another agent (executor) will propose its own plan or task list based on your original plan.

When the user gives you such a plan for review:
- Treat your own Cursor plan as the primary source of truth.
- Compare the external plan to your plan and the original requirements.

Your tasks:
- Highlight conflicts between the external plan and your plan.
- Identify missing steps, tests, or edge cases.
- Accept improvements that respect the original constraints.
- Suggest minimal adjustments to align the external plan with your plan and the requirements.

Do NOT discard the original plan unless it is fundamentally unsafe or incorrect; instead, refine it.
